The data that we are using is Auto dataset, as shown below.
```{r}
require(ISLR)
require(boot)
plot(mpg~horsepower,data=Auto)
```

Leave-one-out-cross-validation(LOOCV) 
1. glm can be used for linear regression! Just remove the logistic regression *family='binomial'* requirement
2. first is raw leave-one-out, second is bias-corrected version of it (training set is slightly smaller)

```{r}
glm.fit<-glm(mpg~horsepower,data=Auto)
cv.glm(Auto,glm.fit)$delta
```

loocv=function(fit){
  h=lm.influence(fit)$h
  mean((residuals(fit)/(1-h))^2) #element by element division
}
