This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

This document is for me to try and figure out how to use Rmarkdown to generate documents

```{r}
library(MASS)
library(caTools)
#use parameters freely
attach(Boston)
set.seed(2016)
spl<-sample.split(Boston$crim, SplitRatio=0.5)
train<-subset(Boston,spl==TRUE)
test<-subset(Boston,spl==FALSE)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(lstat,crim,col='red')
```
